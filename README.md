# hello-world
------
I love good food and good beer.  
I cook good food, and I brew good beer.

I'm in Springboard's career oriented bootcamp for data science.  
I'm learning Python, machine learning, and data data data.
Sometimes my head hurts.  
Sometimes I'm amazed at what I can do with a lot of data and a little code.
I hope to find meaningful work soon.
